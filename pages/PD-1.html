        <h2>dear devdiaries,</h2>
        <p>This week our group focused on putting together the project pitch presentation and the draft previsualization document. Our group is quite large (8 people) and that comes with a lot of different ideas and views on what they want the project to look like. </p>
        <p>As one of the lead administrators on this project, I’ve learned that it’s important to have a meeting agenda and core goals to tackle/discuss. Everyone is very eager to share ideas for different games or game mechanics, but at times it can get a bit off track. We can accidentally end up discussing minute details instead of focusing on the bigger ideas that are necessary at this stage. Meetings can end up lasting 2+ hours, which is difficult to document and also a bit inefficient. There’s a fine balance between making sure the group stays focused while still allowing space for everyone to voice their ideas.</p>
        <p>To try limiting this problem, we try to have our meeting goals defined and announced at the start of the meeting. Ideas are still very much welcome and noted, but if necessary, I try to shift the conversation back to the goals mentioned at the start of the meeting. </p>
       <p>This is my first time helping to manage a large group project and it’s very exciting but it is definitely a lot of work as well!</p>
        <p>Sincerely, Beverly!</p>
